					<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Licensor has given to the User at least [30 days'] written notice, following the failure to pay, of its intention to terminate this EULA in accordance with this Clause 15.5.</p>

					<p>16.5&nbsp; Within [10 Business Days] following the termination of this EULA, the User must:</p>

					<p>17.2&nbsp; If any provision of this EULA is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions of this EULA will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the parties, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).</p>
					<p>17.3&nbsp; This EULA may not be varied except by a written document signed by or on behalf of each of the parties.</p>
					<p>17.4&nbsp; The User hereby agrees that the Licensor may assign the Licensor's contractual rights and obligations under this EULA to [any successor to all or a substantial part of the business of the Licensor from time to time] OR [any third party]. Save to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, the User must not without the prior written consent of the Licensor assign, transfer or otherwise deal with any of the User's contractual rights or obligations under this EULA.</p>
					<p>17.5&nbsp; This EULA is made for the benefit of the parties and is not intended to benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party. The rights of the parties to terminate, rescind, or agree any amendment, waiver, variation or settlement under or relating to this EULA are not subject to the consent of any third party.</p>
					<p>17.6&nbsp; Subject to Clause 14.1, this EULA shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this EULA, and shall supersede all previous agreements, arrangements and understandings between the parties in respect of that subject matter.</p>
					<p>17.7&nbsp; This EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with [English law].</p>
					<p>17.8&nbsp; The courts of [England] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising under or in connection with this EULA.</p>

					<p>18.2&nbsp; The Clause headings do not affect the interpretation of this EULA.</p>
